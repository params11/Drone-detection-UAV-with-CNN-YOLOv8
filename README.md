# Drone-detection-UAV-with-CNN-YOLOv8
 
UAVs have grown rapidly in recent years, creating opportunities and challenges for many industries. UAVs can be difficult to detect and identify, especially if they pose a public safety risk. 

The project focuses on developing a drone detection system using neural network techniques. The project aims to prevent potential physical and cyber-attacks posed by UAVs.

Neural network models used: - 
   1.	CNN is a type of neural network architecture that is specifically designed for image and video recognition tasks. It consists of convolutional layers, pooling         layers, and fully connected layers that enable the network to learn features and patterns from the input images.
   2.	VGG16 and ResNet50 are both pre-trained CNN models that have been trained on large datasets of images, and they can be used for tasks such as image                     classification and object detection.
   3.	YOLO is a specific object detection technique that uses a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities for the detected objects. It         divides the input image into a grid of cells and predicts bounding boxes relative to the cell coordinates and size.

In summary, CNN, VGG16, ResNet50, and YOLO are all related to neural network models and techniques used for various computer vision tasks such as image recognition, classification, and object detection.
